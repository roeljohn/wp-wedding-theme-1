 * page. The template file home.php is used to render the blog posts index, whether it is being
 * used as the front page or on separate static page. If home.php does not exist, WordPress will
 * use index.php.
 * 
 * If front-page.php exists, it will override the home.php template

 * index.php last one to be called if home.php and front-page.php can find in wp
